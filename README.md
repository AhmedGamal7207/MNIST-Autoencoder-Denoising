# MNIST-Autoencoder-Denoising
This project uses a CNN autoencoder to denoise images from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to remove Gaussian noise from digit images, enhancing clarity. It adds noise to the dataset, trains the autoencoder, and evaluates performance by comparing denoised images to the original ones.
